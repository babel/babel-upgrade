# babel-upgrade

> A tool that tries to automatically update most dependencies, config files, and JavaScript files that require Babel packages directly to [Babel 7](http://babeljs.io/docs/en/v7-migration.html) (and more in the future).

## Usage

Run at the root of your git repo:

> If using npm < v5.2.0, install [npx](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b) globally.

```bash
# npx lets you run babel-upgrade without installing it locally
npx babel-upgrade --write

# or install globally and run
npm install babel-upgrade -g
babel-upgrade --write
```

Without the `--write` (or `-w`) flag, `babel-upgrade` will print a diff without writing any changes.

Optionally, add `--install` (or `-i`) as well to run `yarn` or `npm` after writing the upgrade.

```bash
npx babel-upgrade --write --install
```

```

- [ ] Log when replacing out preset-es2015,16,17,latest as FYI
- [ ] Figure out how to change nested .babelrcs into using "overrides" instead
- [ ] Monorepo support
- [ ] `.babelrc.js` and other js files with a config like presets, `webpack.config.js`
- [ ] convert `only`/`ignore` if necessary
- [ ] remove `typeof-symbol` if using `@babel/preset-env` + loose
- [ ] Update test files that use babel directly (`babel-types` -> `@babel/types`, `babel-core`)
  - [ ] Update all requires/imports
  - [ ] Update the use of the Babel API (plugins, integrations)
- [ ] Modify other config files as we go
- [ ] Add to the upgrade guide which parts are autofixable and the command (if we care enough to make this individually runnable too infrastructure wise)
- [ ] May need to add a warning on any 3rd party plugins since they might not be compatible
- [ ] Handle the differences in plugins in v7 for default/loose/spec
- [ ] Should certain parts be generic (replace the string `babel-register` with `@babel/register`)? Could be in a Makefile or somewhere else, but it's just find replace.

## Philosophy

- Move this into the monorepo when somewhat ready
  - Maybe move into `@babel/cli`?
  - Or just another package that is intended to be used via `npx/globally`
- Whenever there is a breaking change in a PR we should also update this tool when possible or at least provide a warning
  - What about with a regression?
- Can be used for non-major bumps too - just for updating to the latest version.
- Include mini-changelog?
- Maybe the version should just reflect the version that it targets?

## Development
```Shell
npm install
npm start
```
